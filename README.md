* A RESTful service that can preform the following actions: 

1. Respond to an HTTP GET request at /products/{id} and delivers product data as JSON (where {id} will be a number. 

2. Reads pricing information from a NoSQL data store and combines it with the product id and name from the HTTP request into a single response. 

3. Performs an HTTP GET to retrieve the product name from an external API. (redsky.target.com,)

- Example product IDs: 15117729, 16483589, 16696652, 16752456, 15643793) 

- Example response: {"id":13860428,"name":"The Big Lebowski (Blu-ray) (Widescreen)","current_price":{"value": 13.49,"currency_code":"USD"}}
